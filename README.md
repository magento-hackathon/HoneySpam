# About Hackathon Magento Honey Spam

This Magento Extension adds a field which is hidden with JavaScript to the Customer Register and the Product Review Form which looks like the URL Field of a Wordpress Comment Form.
If this field gets filled and the Form is send, there appears a error message and nothing will be saved.

There is also a check if this form is too fast transmitted, a human normally takes a couple of Seconds or more.

You can enable and disable the functionalities or set the time how long it should take to transmit this forms in the Magento Admin Backend.

Freshly added: Regex-checking on all input-fields to determine a loose index for spam-level. It is not the most accurate thing at all, but it may prevent the low-end spam ("broadband spam"). You also can enable/disable this feature in the backend and set a maximum spam index trust level.
